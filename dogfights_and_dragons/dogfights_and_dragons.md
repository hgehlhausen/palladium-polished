# Races

## Humans

### Description
Standard, everyday, uquenchable and diverse humans. Humans have multiple cultures and languages and are native to Planet Earth. 

Before the Crystal War, Humans warred with eachother for land, resources, and ideaologies. After the Crystal war, Humans continued warring with eachother for that *and* Dark Elements.

<div class="descriptive">

### Traits

##### Size: 11
Healthy Weight around 75 Kg, Average Height 180&plusmn;50 cm
##### Build: Medium

##### Adaptable
Attribute Bonuses +2 Intelligence (IQ), +2 Focus (ME), +2 Beauty (PB)

##### Perserverence
Humans tend to perservere through injuries, when adrenaline kicks in and its *do or die*. **Add +40 SDC** at character creation. 

##### Psionics
At character creation, roll a d100. Rolling below 13-25, Minor psionics. Rolling 1-12 means Major Psionics. **Optional** - a character can choose **not** to roll psionics.

</div>

#### Adaptable
Humans are adaptable and smart. They can recognize patterns and manipulate those patterns for their benefit. Their evolution severely favored Intelligence and Focus over physical strength.

#### Perserverence
Humans are often undaunted by failure, but especially in fight or flight scenarios their adrenaline kicks in and increases their response time.

#### Psionics
Since exposure to dark elements, the Human Race has been starting to exhibit changes. Through birth or circumstance ( its not yet understood ) some humans have Psionic abilities.

To determine if a character is psionic, roll a d100. If 12-25, a character has Minor Psionics, and on a roll of 1-12, they have Major Psionics. on 26-100, the character is not psionic.

## Gun-Bunnies
Otherwise known as a Carrot Kid, Hopper or a Coney Chick, officially known as Laporidites
### Description
Most often a mutation on the "Pleasure Bunny" artificial species, or an unlucky human caught by Gene-Splicers, fur covers the entire body of these Humanoids. Though they can be mistaken for human in low-light conditions, they have rabbit ears, round eyes, slight muzzle, a thick neck and body, and powerful wide haunches ended with 4-toed stubby feet. The pads of the hands and feet have human looking skin.

Different kinds of Leporidites are found around the world, though rare, and have differing coats and ears, based on the source Rabbit DNA. Exclusively Herbivore

Organizations that peddle in Pleasure Bunnies usually destroy Leporidites in the womb or the test-tube before they gestate, though Slavers are known to use more brutal methods of displosal. By posting hefty dead-or-alive bounties, those Leporidites that escape this fate often live on the run, the punchline to destiny's cruel joke.


<div class="descriptive">
### Traits

##### Size 9
Healthy Weight around 78 Kg, average height around 130±15cm

##### Expressive Ears
-2 Physical Beauty (P.B.), +1 Initiative<br>

Hear very faint sounds (light footsteps, small animals breathing), conversation at a much greater distance than is humanly possible.

Their ears are also expressive, allowing simple communication or expression of emotions.

##### Pain Tolerance 
Gun-Bunnies are tougher than humans and start with +35 SDC

##### Graceful 
+3 Physical Prowess (P.P.), +4 to roll with fall or knockdown impact
Gun-Bunnies are inherently graceful and nimble.


##### Powerful Legs
At character creation, add 3d6+25 to Speed (Spd)

Additionally Maximum standing leap height is 3 meters and 4.5 meters height with a running start. They can jump down 6 meters without penalty.

##### Lean and Mean
+3 Physical Strength, +1 Physical Endurance


##### Vegitarian
If a Gun-Bunny eats meat or animal protien, they become <span style="text-decoration:underline; font-weight: bold">Violently Ill</span> (-3 on initiative, -2 on all other combat moves, and reduce Spd. by 40%.)

&nbsp;

### Expressive Ears
-2 Physical Beauty (P.B.), +1 Initiative<br>

Gun-Bunnies can hear very faint sounds (light footsteps, small animals breathing). The character can also overhear conversation at four times  the distance than is normally possible from a human.

Their ears are also expressive, allowing simple communication or expression of emotions. Much like breathing, this is partially conscious and partially unconscious movment.

**For Example** a happy Gun-Bunny's ears perk up, or a bound and gagged one might point their ears up to indicate a trap.

Part of the reason for bounties on Leporidites is that they don't conform to the common definition human beauty very well, but still contain trade secrets in their DNA for the beautiful Pleasure Bunny.

### Pain Tolerance
**+35 SDC**

Gun-Bunnies are tougher than normal humans. Their hard lives have given them a pain tolerance that lets them ignore deep bruises and scratches.

### Graceful
**+3 Physical Prowess (P.P.), +4 to roll with fall or knockdown impact**

Gun-Bunnies are inherently graceful and nimble. The grace is a survival feature when moving at the extreme speeds they can travel - there's no seatbelt when you trip moving 40 kph, but the asphault will give you a hug.

### Powerful Legs
**+3d6+25 Speed (Spd)**

Gun-Bunnies can leap, fall and run with _extreme predjudice_, and they accelerate to a minimum 33 kph in 15 seconds. Its not all about linear movement - they can leap up to 3 full meters into the air, 4.5 if they get a running start, and they can land from a 6 meter drop with no damage.

### Lean and Mean
**+3 Physical Strength (P.S.), +1 Physical Endurance (P.E)**

Gun-Bunnies' life on the run give them much opportunity to burn calories, and it seems a few of the Pleasure Bunny genes were passed on. Fat Gun-Bunnies get caught, so you don't see any.

### Vegitarian
Their diet doesn't help much - they often consume pounds of lettuce, radishes, and of course carrots, but anything they can get their hands on.

Some Gun-Bunnies try to eat meat, or even vegetebal soup with _beef broth_ but their systems just can't process it. They become **Violently Ill** if they eat animal protien.

### Description:
Extensively used in research, white-furred, pink-eyed rabbits were among the first mammals to have their genetic code analyzed and experimented upon. What happened afterwards were wholesale attempts to replicate different human functions through the insertion of human DNA.

We can only assume that someone decided it would be amusing, or profitable, to create "bunnies" as human sex toys. The result was a new humanoid species that had the ultimate in sex appeal. Equipped not just with devastatingly good looks, and luscious bodies, but with the ability to release a cocktail of sex hormones.

<div class="descriptive">

### Traits

##### Size: 8

##### Build: Medium

##### Attribute Bonuses:
+4 M.A., +6 P.B., and +4 Spd.

Used for psionics and limited animal abilities. See Pleasure Bunny Mutations table for options

##### Advanced Vision
Pleasure Bunnies can see double the usual distance and detail of normal human vision.
##### Advanced Hearing
Pleasure Bunnies can hear very faint sounds (light footsteps, small animals breathing). The character can also overhear conversation at a much greater distance than is normally possible.

##### Human Appearance
Nearly perfect human look, except that no living human being could actually appear this attractive, at least not without years of extensive plastic surgery. Thick, luxurious white hair, brilliant pink eyes sometimes augmented with contact lenses, and a perfect pink complexion when untanned. Both males and females have perfect "swimsuit" bodies.

##### Skill: Read Body Language (Special)
Base Skill: 25% +5% for every experience level. 

##### Sex Pheromone Production (Special)

|10|Advanced Touch|
|10|Leaping: Standard|
| 5| Internal Compass|
|-5| Vestigial Rabbit Ears|
|-5| Cotton Tail (special) | 
|-5| Diet: Herbivore|
|-5| Nearsightedness|

### Read Body Language
All Pleasure Bunnies are experts at picking up on the subtle signs of a person's emotions. 

Attuned to the respiration, heartbeat (all have Advanced Hearing), scent, pupil dilation, body gestures and movements, and other physical signs, Pleasure Bunnies can interpret the emotional state and aspects of those around them (angry, frightened, nervous, defensive, anxious, sad, happy, shy, gentle, open, aggressive, rough, and similar). 
They are especially good at figuring out who is attracted to whom in any group, and know instantly whenever they are attracting or repelling anyone. Their accuracy and attunement improves over time.

**Base Skill**: 25% +5% for every experience level. 

### Sex Pheromone Production
At will, Mutant Pleasure Bunnies can release pheromones that excite those around them. Undetectable to everyone except those with "Advanced Smell," the pheromones affect anyone who breathes in the air around the Pleasure Bunnies.

**Save:** DC 16 [non-lethal poison/toxin]. Advanced Smell grants a +2 on this save.


#### Excitement Pheromones
**Pheromone Euphoria** lose all sense of time, loses all initiative, -30% on skill performance.

Released in the air, this chemical is designed to excite human beings, and those with human genes, making them feel a sense of pleasure and of the possibility of a sexual encounter. Pure humans are easily caught up in the euphoria (-1 to save), and will generally feel good and a little "high."

While under the influence, so to speak, characters are distracted and find it difficult to think about anything other than having sex. This means they lose all sense of time, have no initiative and are -30% on skill perfonnance.

No combat penalties should violence erupt.

#### Attraction Pheromones
**Love Struck:** Affliction, distracted, -2 on Initiative, -15% on skill performance. Victim actively seeks the source of the attraction.

The Pleasure Bunny gives off a scent that most other creatures find impossible to ignore. All Pleasure Bunnies can give off either the male or female compounds, or even both at the same time.

Those under the influence are  and long to be with that person, not noticing much of anything else going on around them.


#### Binding Pheromones.
**Love Slave** - Skill Performance -20% when not with the Pleasure Bunny who inflicted the status.

If a Pleasure Bunny decides to concentrate on a single individual, it will, over time, adjust its pheromones in order to appeal just to that one person. Slowly, subtly, over days, the Pleasure Bunny's body chemistry changes, manufacturing a unique chemical designed to target that one individual.

Eventually, after three or more weeks of constant interaction (at least five times a week, probably more than that), the Pleasure Bunny's body chemistry will completely change, so that everything about the Bunny, including both smells and tastes, will be delicious and irresistible to their chosen partner. This effectively makes the individual the Pleasure Bunny's "love slave." This means the character longs to be with his "Bunny" as much as possible and he pines for her when away; skill performance is -20% when not with the Bunny. 

Moreover, the love slave will completely trust and believe his Bunny and take the mutant's word over anybody else. Will only believe the most compelling and irrefutable evidence against his love and even then may be able to accept and forgive any wrongdoings, even terrible crimes. Once things get to this stage, the Pleasure Bunny will be permanently imprinted on her victim, so the character will always be haunted by the Pleasure Bunny's particular looks, touch, taste and, especially, smell.

<div class="descriptive">
 #### Mating for Life
One important thing to remember about Pleasure Bunnies is that they are as vulnerable to each other as anyone else. 

When two Pleasure Bunnies mate, it's always for life, as their body chemistries adapt to each other, knitting chemical attractions to each other that are impossible to break.

A Pleasure Bunny who loses a mate will usually die within a few weeks, unable to adjust to the loss.

#### Weight & Body Fat & Muscle Control (Special)
**Bulk Up** gain one extra point of P.S. every day, up to a maximum of +7 P.S. over their usual strength.

Pleasure Bunnies have the ability to regulate the amount of fat on their bodies, so they can appear as skinny, muscular or fat as they wish, no matter what they eat (so long as they aren't being starved). 

For example, a female Pleasure Bunny could have an "hourglass" figure by consciously adding dense (finn) body fat to her bust and buttocks, while making her stomach and waistline leaner and leaner, changing her measurements as much as an inch per day. 

If the Pleasure Bunny pays attention to the responses of any individual, they can gradually adjust their body type into that person's ideal within a week. 

Any Pleasure Bunny can "bulk up" with muscle, gaining one extra point of P.S. every day, up to a maximum of +7 P.S. over their usual strength.

## Gene-Splicer
### Description:
Gene-Splicers have an odd, nearly featureless appearance. Some will enhance their genetics to show their intellectual superiority to other Gene-Splicers, but the fashion has been Slim and Sheek for several thousand years in their culture.
Gene-Splicers do not speak, being naturally psionic for communication. This lets them project words into others minds - not directly read them.

<div class="descriptive">

### Traits

##### Size Level: 9
Height 1.5m to 2.1m, Weight 38.2 to 112.5 kg<br> Random determination 150cm + 8d6cm. 
##### Build: Medium
##### Genetic Augmentation
Gene-Splicers often augment themselves
Select BIO-E: 10 from the Gene-Splicer Mutations table

##### Attribute Bonuses
+2 Intelligence Quotient (I.Q.) , +2 Mental Eendurance (M.E), +3 Physical Strength (P.S.) , +1 Physical Endurance (P.E.), +35 SDC

##### Mind Speak
Gene-Splicers communicate by projecting words into other individuals minds. This does _not_ let you read minds. Unless the target is psionic, they cannot tell the difference with this and audible voices.
Does not work with audio devices.

##### Bio-Manipulator Adept
By touching a creature ( or fragment of one ), Gene-Splicers can **Sense Genetic Components** and **Reproductive Viability**


##### Mechanical Adept
Repair devices with 100% success with minimal materials and parts.
Range: 75m<br>
After leaving range of repaired device:
- Reduce device abilities by 1d4 x 10%
- Roll d% every 30 minutes of use - 1-75 indicates it breaks again.

After repairing 6 times this way, Rebuilding by real mechanic suffers a -20% skill penalty and takes 1+1d4 x normal duration

</div>
#### Sense Genetic Components
Reaching down to the cellular level, the character can get a sense of the subject's genetics and identify the type of animal from which they have evolved, as well as any genetic modifications or mutations and added genes from other species.
 
#### Determine & Match Fertility
This power tells the "reader" whether or not the subject being psionically scanned is capable of reproducing. The psychic mutant can then "match" the subject against all the other characters he has previously "read" to find a viable mate capable of producing offspring. Many species can not breed with one another, and some mutations cause sterility; this power lets the psychic determine who can mate and reproduce and who can not. A valuable power in order to survive and continue their species.

### Mechanical Adept <br>[Animal Psionic]
Range: 75 meters<br>
Duration: Unlimited<br>
Saving Throw (Reliability): 20% + 5% per level.

After leaving range of repaired device:
- Reduce device abilities by 1d4 x 10%
- Roll d% every 30 minutes of use - device must roll below Saving Throw to continue functioning

After repairing 6 times this way, Rebuilding by real mechanic suffers a -20% skill penalty and takes 1+1d4 x normal duration

The character has a natural affinity for machines. Instead of studying Automotive Mechanics or Mechanical Engineering, the character just senses what is wrong with machines. The mutant seems to communicate directly with the machine, diagnosing and fixing problems and defects with 100% reliability. Better yet, with the Mechanical Adept, most things can be fixed, literally, with "chewing gum and baling wire," and with anything handy as a substitute for a proper replacement part.

There's just one tiny problem: The "fixed" machine only works perfectly as long as the psychic stays within range of the device. As soon as the psychic leaves, the machine is likely to stop working (01-75% chance; roll once for every 30 minutes of use). Even if the device continues to operate it won't run as smoothly or efficiently (reduce speed, range, etc. by 1D4x10%), frequently developing vibrations, knocks, or stutters when away from the psychic who fixed it. Because their work breaks down after they leave, Mechanical Adepts have a bad reputation. 

Ironically, characters with this power honestly believe they do superior and permanent repairs, and can not be made to believe the continued smooth operation of their repairs depends on a psychic link between them and the machines they fix. Thus, they blame others for "mistreating" the machinery. Nothing can convince them their repairs only work while they hang around.

**Note:** After the psychic has performed a 6 "repairs" on the same machine or vehicle, it is completely dependent on that psychic character for it to work. After the sixth repair, 2D6 minutes after he leaves, the machine literally crumbles into a pile of parts, requiring a complete rebuilding by a real mechanic. To make matters worse, all the psychic's tampering and patchwork means such rebuilding is done with a -20% skill penalty for success and takes 1D4 times longer than normal to make the repairs. Probably easier and cheaper just to scrap it.

### Gene-Splicer Mutations

#### Animal Psionics
the Gene-Splicer may spend BIO-E to get get Animal Psionics unless that power specifically states that is not available to humans. Of course, the character must also have the required M.E. to take that power.

# Combat
I have taken the liberty of compiling and cleaning up the combat system depicted in Rifts - Ultimate Edition. You'll note that I have taken some inspiration from D&D 5e, but tried to keep the same gameplay aesthetic. I've also stripped it down the wires, because _how_ are you supposed to play in a game with guns with no mention of guns _in the combat section!_

## Basic Combat

### Bonuses
Some bonuses come from your abilities, most bonuses come from **Skills** and **Class Features**.

### Spending Actions
A player has a number of actions ( usually 4 or above ) they may "spend" to Attack, Dodge, Move, or take an Advanced Action.

Actions spent, even if the effort was a failure, are not recoverable. Any actions not spent during a round are **lost**.


### Initiative and Priority
Determines sequence of character actions within a round.
Every round, **Initiative** is rolled to determine which creature goes first, second, etcetera.

This roll is determined with 1d20 + Initiative Bonuses.

In the event of a tie, the tied creature reroll to see which among them goes first ( their overall Initiative does not change )

When a round begins, the creature with the highest initiative gains **Priority**. While the player has **Priority**, they can expend actions to attack, take-aim, etcetera, until no more Actions remain for that character.

A creature may lose **Priority** due to special actions.

After all actions are expended, or the creature chooses to take no further actions, **Priority** shifts to the next highest initiative.

background-size: 325px;
text-align: center;
}
</style>

<div class="facing">
Credits: d20srd.com
</div>

```
```

### Space and Facing
Combat takes places on a **Combat Grid**. Each space on a grid represents 1 meter, unless otherwise specified.

**Directions** If playing on a Hex Grid, there are 6 directions. If playing on a Square Grid, there are 4 directions.

**Melee Attack Range** for size 1-17 creatures is the space immediately adjacent.

**Ranged Attacks** Firearms grant a +10 to Hit on rolls if the Defender is within 100 meters, and +5 within 250 meters.

Sub-sonic projectiles do not gain this benefit ( arrows, thrown knives, rocks, etc)

**Facing** Each creature has a direction its facing, so **Angle of Attack** matters.
Attacking from a target's **Flank** grants **+5 to Hit**, and from the **Rear** have a **+10 to hit**.



### Attack Actions ( Strikes )
All attacks here forth will be called **Strikes** to clear-up confusion. Even using a **Firearm** is called a Strike for consistency. 

They cost **1 action** to perform. **A Natural 1 always fails.**

#### Melee
**Attacker** 1d20 + [to Hit] vs<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Defender's Dodge Roll**

**Note**: Melee attacks can be parried.

#### Firearms
**Note:** Ranged Attacks _cannot_ be Parried

**Attacker** 1d20 + [To Hit] Bonuses vs<br> **Defender's Dodge Roll** 

#### Counter Strikes
Counter attacks function exactly like normal attacks, but must be taken immediately after a **successful Dodge Action**

### Movement Actions
Movement has a few different actions.

#### Dance / Weave
Spending **1 action**, you mave move your **Speed / 5** in spaces. You end **Facing any direction you choose**

#### Engage / Disengage
**Once per round**, Spending **0 actions**, You may 

move 1 space and engage in melee combat. You end **Facing The Opponent**

**OR**

move 1 space out of melee range of a target opponent, **Facing The Opponent**.

#### Run
Spending **1 action**, you may move up to your **Speed x 5** spaces. You end **Facing the direction you last moved in.**

#### Change Direction

Spending **1 action**, you change your **Facing** to any direction you choose.

</style>

### Dodge Actions
Dodge actions are defensive - they prevent a creature from being damaged, or reduce the damage they take.

#### Parry or Block

Spending **0 actions**, a creature may **Parry** an incoming Melee Attack. This action is only available to characters who are **Combat Trained** ( via a skill )

**Defender** 1d20 + Parry Bonus vs **Attacker's Roll**

**Roleplay Note:** Creatures who Parry do "touch" an item with themselves or their weapon.

#### Dodge
Spending **1 action** A creature may attempt to completely **Dodge** an attack.

**Defender** 1d20 + Dodge Bonus vs **Attacker's Roll**

**Note:** Moving at excessive speeds

#### Roll with Impact
Sending **1 action** A character may choose to accept half damage instead of completely dodging. Some creatures receive a **specific bonus** from their class or skills for these checks, making this sometimes worth-while

**Note:** Only available vs **Melee** attacks

(also referred to as **Roll with Punch** and **Roll with Fall** )

### Armor

Armor is a defensive covering, that can outright prevent damage.

Armor has an AR number ( Armor Rating ). If an attack roll does **not** exceed this number, no damage is dealt.

### Damage

When a **Strike Action** Succeeds, damage is dealt

#### From Equipment
The amount and type of damage is specified in the **Equipment**'s entry.

Typically, weapons do SDC unless otherwise noted. If an equipment meets a specific condition per creature, it may deal MDC instead to that creature. **For Example** a Silver Bullet vs a Supernatural Were-Wolf will deal Mega Damage instead.

```
```

#### Improvised Weapons
|Weapon|Damage| Example |
|:-----|-----:|:-------:|
|Wooden Club|1d8| Chair Leg|
|Metal Club| 2d4| Lead Pipe
|Broken Glass | 1d6| Broken<br>window
|Stone | 1d4 | Asphault<br>Chunk


#### Unarmed Damage

|Body Part|Damage|
|:----|:---|
|Fist | 1d4 |
|Torso| 1d6 |
|Elbow| 1d6 |
|Forearm|1d6 
|Knee| 1d6
|Foot | 1d8

#### Accepting Damage

When a creature accepts damage, they first deduct it from their SDC, then any remaining points of damage are removed from their HP

#### Roleplay and Circumstance

##### Falling Damage
Creatures receive 1d6 damage per 3 meters of falling distance to a maximum of 20d6. This assumes Earth-like gravity.

##### Vehicle Damage and Collisions
**Collisions** deal 1d4 per 10 Kph of Speed. If both objects / creatures are moving, use the difference between their speeds in Kph.

Some extraordinary characters can move at extreme speeds. In collisions, **Both colliders** take full damage.

##### Healing Damage

See the **Body Fixer** and similar O.C.C.'s for repairing damage to creatures.

### Misc
#### Rounds
One complete **Initiative** sequence is a **Round**. At the start of every round, all creatures still alive and acting within the combat **Roll Initiative** again.

#### Time

Each round is 15 seconds - there are 4 per 1 minute.

#### Speaking
A character can say as many as 30 words in a single round without using an action, but after 31 and 30 thereafter cost 1 action to communicate the concept.

## Advanced Combat

<hr>

> ##### Strike / Counter Strike Chains
> A Counter Strike allow the Defender to take the Counter Strike action also.
> 
This results in a counter strike "Chain". A chain ends when one player cannot or chooses not to "Counter Strike" in response.

### Hand 2 Hand
Martial Arts Traning or Cybernetic Enhancements may increase damage from unarmed strikes. Here is a table for the default available options to character explained in **Rifts Ultimate Edition®**, which I've cleaned up a little.

|Attack Name| Damage| Actions<br>Cost|
|:--|--:|:---:|
|Karate Punch&ast;| 2d4| 1
|Karate Kick&ast;| 2d6| 1
|Power [Strike]| x2| 2
|Leap Kick| 3d8 | 2
|Death Blow| x2 | 2

<span style="text: 0.9em;">&ast;Requires</span>

#### Death Blow
Deathblows only succeed on a natural 18, 19, or 20, but deal double damage. Deathblows are always **Melee Strikes**

### Special Actions
Sometimes a character wants to capture, restrain, or assist

#### Hold or Entangle
On a successful Dodge Action, a character may attempt to Hold instead of Counter-Striking. Defender may use **1 action** to roll 1d20 + Prowess vs the Attacker's Strike roll.

On a success, the **Attacker is Grappled**, and is considered Flanked for all other attacks. 

#### Trip or Knockdown
When a character chooses to perform  a Melee Strike, they may declare ( before rolling ) that they are attempting to Trip.

On a successful attack, **Instead of Damage**, the Defender rolls a Balance Check. If the defending character does not have **Balance**, then they must roll a d100 below the 

**Base Save**, 50 - (5 x ( Attacker Strength - 20 min 0) )


### Skills

Making a skill check in combat usually costs **1 action**, at GM discretion.

```
```

### Extreme Range and Sneak Attacks

#### Priority Explained
**Priority**  In the rest of the rules, the term "Has the initiative" is passed around. Priority is a term for who "has the initiative" in these rules.

#### Extreme Range

At extreme ranges, usually far off any combat map, such as Sniper Rifles, are considered an **Environmental Effect**, and do not roll Initiative - they automatically go first and receive **Priority**


#### Surprise and Stealthy Strikes

When a character chooses to be the first to attack prior to combat, and takes steps to achieve that goal, such as sneaking with Prowl or Disguising themselves, their actions are specifically what initiates combat.

The Attacker has their own Round of Combat Actions to take actions, and automatically receives Priority during this round.

As soon as the Attacker **loses Priority**, roll Initiative  and continue combat as normal.

### Mega Damage and MDC

Certain weapons and supernatural creatures deal Mega Damage. Megadamage ( sometimes MD ) is in its own category.

Narratively, its a massive amount of damage that is almost always lethal to the average human.

#### MDC ( Hitpoints Type 3 )
MDC Damage is always removed first, then SDC, and then HP, with 1 exception. When all MDC has been removed - **stop accepting damage** - the remaining damage is lost and the creature's SDC is untouched.

#### Mega Damage Weapons

When a character wearing Mega Damage Armor takes Mega Damage, remove the damage from the MDC as normal.

##### Mega Damage Without MDC Armor

When a character **not** wearing Mega Damage Armor takes Mega Damage, calculate it as 100 SDC damage = 1 Mega Damage and follow normal rules for accepting damage.


#### Mega Damage Armor

To combat Mega Damage Weapons, there is Mega Damage Armor.

Creatures wearing Mega Damage Armor ( sometimes in the form of a Vehicle ) remove Mega Damage from their MDC in the same way as SDC damage from SDC.


##### SDC Damage against MDC ARmor
When a character wearing Mega Damage Armor is dealt SDC Damage, for every 100 SDC damage, rounded down, do 1 point of Mega Damage to the MDC on the armor. **Amounts of SDC damage less than 100 deal 0 MDC damage.**

<div class='footnote'> Combat | Advanced Combat</div>

## Dogfighting
**Air 2 Air** is a fine art of shooting other aircraft out of the sky, and not getting shot down yourself.

### Pilot Bonuses

Instead of using Hand 2 Hand combat bonuses, instead use the relevant Pilot [Vehicle] Skill / 15, rounded down.

**Pilot Bonus: Skill% / 15** 

#### Seat of your Pants Flying
If a character does **not** have the appropriate skill, its -10% if they have a "close" skill, -20% for any aircraft skill not closely related, and -30% if they have no flight skills whatsoever. Use the penalized bonus for the **Pilot Bonus** if appropriate.

### Actions

For Simplicity and Continuity, a Pilot's number of actions are the same as granted by their Basic Combat Actions. 


### Initiative and Priority

**Initiative** and **Priority** remain largely the same, with 1 exception.

After a successful Dodge Action, the Defender **gains Priority** ( they may initiate attacks and spend actions for maneuvers / movement ). See **Attack Actions** for more details.

### Space &amp; Facing

Because of the full 3 dimensions and high speed nature of **Dogfighting**, only "General" location and arrangement matter.

**Continue to track Facing** on a grid or sheet of paper, maybe some scribbles of notes on distance to other aircraft.

#### Engaged and Disengaging

Planes who attack eachother become **Engaged** and should be kept together. Usually plans are flanked, but if one out-turns the other or uses an advanced manuever, one can be behind the other and **Take Aim**

**Manuevers and Attacks are separate** actions
#### Turning
About every 90&deg; in a forward-pushing aircraft ( like a fighter jet or prop plane ) plane costs 1 action as a **Benchmark**. The **GM** should use judgement on how far a character can turn beyond 90&deg;

#### Stabalizing

Leveling Out and Regaining Control can be challenging depending on the manuevers and stunt-flying a character performs. the **GM** should use their best judgement on Stabalizing Check difficulties. **Benchmark:** Roll below the appropriate Pilot[Vehicle] check for the current craft.

### Spending Actions
**Narrative Matters** from players in Air 2 Air combat, and unless otherwise specified, an aircraft **cannot stop moving** during around. Some **common maneuvers** are listed in the A2A Combat Table


### Strikes

Strikes cost 1 action usually, but to **Take Aim** also costs 1 action - see Manuevers

#### Bullets & Lasers
Firing Attacks with **Mounted Guns** requires that a character line-up the shot to have any accuracy.

WIthout a **Take Aim** Action immediately before it, a **Bullet Strike** action suffers a -2 on the Roll.

#### Missiles

Firing missiles has some major advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage is that the Attacker **only has to Face the Defender** - no Take Aim action is required.

The Disadvandage however is that Missiles can be expensive - the pocketbook won't be useful without a living character however.

**Missles are their own craft** and have their own section below.

##### Air to Ground
Unless an aircraft can hover, they take a -5 on Strike rolls to aim at ground targets.

##### Ground to Air

Attacks by hand-guns and small arms only deal damage to the pilot on a Natural 20.

Against **Supersonic Aircraft**, Anti-Aircraft Guns and other specialized equipment rolls Strikes normally, but gain +5 on their Strike Rolls at close range. Long range does not gain this bonus.

### Dodging

#### Manuevers
Manuevers are the main action of aircraft - Dodging can be anything from S-Curving, to flying through canyons, to **Slamming on the Breaks**

Any Dodge Manuever is a **Pilot Roll** that must meet or exceed the Attacker's **Strike Roll**

**All Dodge rolls require a Stabalize Check**

###  Ammunition
During Combat, many **GM**'s and players forget to handle every-day Ammunition. **Recommendation:** Don't worry about how many blasts the lasers can fire or how many rounds the guns are loaded with during Air 2 Air combat. **Missiles &amp; Bombs** should **not** gain this benefit however - they are expensive and special and should feel both worth it to use and special when used.

### Fuel
Tracking Fuel usage is more for long-term or long-distance flights, and should follow the usage denoted in the Aircraft's entry.

However, as an optional rule, **1 Manuever should cost 3% Maximum Fuel** of fuel in high velocity dogfighting. **After Burners** are inefficient in dogfights and should **double the fuel used**.

#### Dogfighting Maneuver Table
|Maneuver|Action<br>Cost|Stabalize<br>Check?|Example Narrative|
|:-------|:---------:|:----------------:|:-------|
|Climb| 1  | | I pull back on the stick and aim for the sun| 
|Dive| 1 |  &check; |I put the stick down and line up the sites on my!|
|Level out| 1 |  &check;| Pull up! PULL UP!|
|Barrel Roll| 1 |  &check;| I spin the plane to confuse the missile!|
|U-Turn | 2 |  &check;| I pull back until the plain flips over and turn it over|
|Take Aim| 1 |  &check;| I steady the plane and aim for their engines!| 
|Bullet Strike| 1 | | The Gattling Guns roar in rage and lead fury!<br>or<br> Pew Pew! (laser sound)|

|Slam on the Breaks| 3&sup1; | &check; | I throw out the flaps and the landing gear and slow down so my enemy passes me!

<br>&sup1; This action should have a penalty on the Pilot Roll to stabalize, as it is actually really insane. a Failed roll could result in losing the landing gear or damage to the aircraft, falling out of the sky, or the enemy craft colliding with the executing craft
</div>

### Missiles

#### Strikes

Rolling to Strike with Missles is simple if effective. There are no inherent bonuses to firing a missile. Roll 1d20 + Missle Modifiers ( default 0 ).

On a total roll of 4 or less, the missile automatically misses.

##### Air 2 Air Missiles
Air 2 Air missiles may gain bonuses on the d20 by the Missile's or the Aircraft's equipment description.

#### Dodging Missiles
The Dodge rules are the same for missiles as they are for combat with guns, except for Vollies, as noted below.

##### Vollies of Missiles

Separate missiles can be dodged ( 1, 2, 3 fires at the same time ) - however 4+ missiles launched simultaneously are called a **Volly**

**Vollies cannot be dodged or parried**

##### Shooting Missiles

A missile may be shot and damaged while in flight.

**Only 1 action may be taken to attack a missile, and that 1 attack must deal damage equal to or exceeding its MDC**

#### Damage
##### Direct Hits

Direct hits cause full damage as described in the Missile's Equipment Entry

##### Blast Radius and Near Misses
Getting caught in the blast radius deals 50% damage

##### Rolling with Impact

By spending 1 full action, a creature may minimize the damage of a direct hit or explosive force from a **missile**. 

Roll 1d20 + **Roll with Impact** Modifiers vs the Strike Roll.
If there is no strike roll ( such as a mine or accidental explosion ), the default Strike is 14.

## Equipment Tables
Mega Damage Equipment seems to be covered. I've made some lesser options, usually from 0-3 MD in scope. 

Pay no attention to prices - I don't have the experience to calculate / guess at them.

## Animal Psionics

### General Rule
Unlike normal Psionics, Animal Psionic usage is infinite, but only one power can be used at a time.

### Natural Mechanical Genius
Range: 250 feet (76.2 m).<br>
Duration: Unlimited.<br>
Minimum M.E.: 8<br>
Saving Throw (Reliability): 25% + 5% per level. Cost: 10 BfO-E.<br>

The character has a natural affinity for machines. Instead of studying Automotive Mechanics or Mechanical Engineering, the character just senses what is wrong with machines. The mutant seems to communicate directly with the machine, diagnosing and fixing problems and defects with 100% reliability. Better yet, with the Natural Mechanical Genius, most things can be fixed, literally, with "chewing gum and baling wire," and with anything handy as a substitute for a proper replacement part.

There's just one tiny problem. The "fixed" machine only works perfectly as long as the psychic stays within 250 feet (76 m) of the device. As soon as the psychic leaves, the machine is likely to stop working (01-75% chance; roll once for every 30 minutes of use). Even if the device continues to operate it won't run as smoothly or efficiently (reduce speed, range, etc. by 1D4xI0%), frequently developing vibrations, knocks, or stutters when away from the Natural Mechanical Genius who fIXed it. Because their work breaks down after they leave, Mechanical Geniuses have a bad reputation. 

Ironically, characters with this power honestly believe they do superior and permanent repairs, and can not be made to believe the continued smooth operation of their repairs depends on a psychic link between them and the machines they fix. Thus, they blame others for "mistreating" the machinery. Nothing can convince them their repairs only work while they hang around.

Note: After the psychic has performed a half dozen "repairs" on the same machine or vehicle, it is completely dependent on that psychic character for it to work. After the sixth repair, 2D6 minutes after he leaves, the machine literally crumbles into a pile of parts, requiring a complete rebuilding by a real me­ chanic. To make matters worse, all the psychic's tampering and patchwork means such rebuilding is done with a -20% skill pen­ alty for success and takes ID4 times longer than normal to make the repairs. Probably easier and cheaper just to scrap it.

## Mutations
### References
#### Ears, Vestigial
**Stat Change**: -1 to M.A. and -2 to P.B.<br>
**Cost** -5 BIO-E (gain 5 points)<br>
The character has huge ears, at least as long or large as the rest of the character's head, and provide no bonus to hearing.

However, they are very expressive, and can often be used to convey the character's mood (perky, depressed, curious, etc.), and can be used to signal other characters.

#### Diet : Herbivore
**Cost** -5 BIO-E (gain 5 points)<br>

These characters eat plants exclusively, usually vegetables and fruits. Attempts to eat meat will make the character **Violently Ill**. 

#### Cotton Tail [Pleasure Bunny]
**Cost** -5 (gain 5 points)<br>
**Obviously Not Human**
Its only negative feature is that the character can never "pass for human" if a physical examination is made, and the bulge may show through clothing. Some folks find a cotton tail cute and exotic. 

#### Nearsighted
**Cost** -5 BIO-E (gain 5 points)<br>
The character can only see clearly when things are very close up (30cm), and the character can not see anything but blurred shapes, color and movement of anything beyond his range of vision.

**Range of Clarity** At character creation, roll clarity distance 3d6x10+60 of centimeters. Anything beyond that point is a blur.

**Maximum Site Range** Useful vision stops at 8d6+1 meters.

**Example:** After choosing "Nearsighted," for his Human, Tom first rolls a 11, so his human's range of clarity is 1.7 meters, seeing clearly about 2 arms-lengths away from himself.

Next, Tom rolls for Max Range and gets 25, 25 meters and cannot see anything further than 25 meters away.

#### Righting Reflex
**Cost** 10 BIO-E<br>
**Bonus: +4 to roll with fall or knockdown impact (not punches and kicks).**

When falling, the animal will automatically orient itself, relax, and land in a way to minimize any damage, and usually lands on their feet or all fours (hands and feet). In cats, this is a unique "vestibular apparatus" that allows them to orient themselves in midair and land safely on all fours, spreading and absorbing damage that would be otherwise fatal.
