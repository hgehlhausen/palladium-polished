 Check them out, support them to - this is a great setting that's incredibly detailed.

This repository is to facilitate cooperation on people who love this system and setting.

I've been performing taxonomical analysis and rewriting some parts of this system.

Example "improvements"

- one experience table for all OCC's, with Hand 2 Hand combat skill starting actions added to assist in character creation.
- Shortening length
- Distinct race bonuses that are not RCC's; this can help players used to other systems find a foot-hold.
- Trait boxes for races for quick reference
- Phrasing usage of Supersonic Ammunition in ranged attacks as a +10 Bonus to hit instead of a penalty on Dodge rolls.
- Cleaning up combat explanations to have Basic Combat, Advanced Combat, and "Dogfighting" ( Air 2 Air Combat )
- (partial) Centralized Listing of equipment
